            Facescanned</h1>
        <p class="abstract">
            Archive that collects and catalogs face images of people who decided to take part to the project 
            by scanning their own faces. No indication was given about the output, leaving total freedom to 
            the people to position themselves as they preferred. From there, the most interesting method of 
            cataloging was chosen: direction. Some people look to the right, some look up, some are 
            positioned frontally, etc. If we move in front of the screen then the photos will always have 
            their eyes facing us, following us and looking at us all the time.

        <p>
            To reach 200 photos, it was necessary to ask as many people as possible to participate to the project, 
            spreading the word among friends and family. Along with the scanners, I also received some photos of 
            people who enjoyed scanning their own faces at home, at friends' house or at work.

            The main interaction is done using the face, this is to keep consistency with the subjects of the images. 
            Moving to the right, left, top or bottom will filter the images, showing those with the tag of our 
            interest to make sure that the gaze of the people is always towards us. This is possible using json and poseNet.

            To aid the user's orientation, a small box has been inserted in the lower left corner showing the subdivision 
            of the page and the position where you are.

        <p>
            Json allows data to be attributed to each individual image, in this case it collects person's data such as name, 
            date of birth, and direction of gaze.

            The poseNet recognizes facial points such as eyes and nose, identifying them in space through x and y coordinates. 
            By measuring the distance between the nose and eye, it's then possible to measure how far the user is positioned from the computer.
            In the moment when the nose is within specific x and y coordinates as well as within a certain distance, then images that have 
            different tag than the one we are interested in will be identified in the json, hided and then showed only those that match the selected filter.

            Pictures can be reordered by age, in increasing or decreasing order.
            By clicking control we will see the adult pictures first, vice versa by clicking option it will be possible to reorder them starting with the youngest. 
            Again the date-date has been specified in the json file where the date of birth of each one has been entered. Through js the dates are compared and reordered.

            The archive can be disordered by placing the scanners in random order.
            This is achieved by moving the window inside the screen whose position can be identified through the use of x and y coordinates. 
            When coordinate values change, the random function is activated, which arranges the images in random order.

            Once the chosen image is enlarged by clicking, to view the next or previous one simply move by 
            clicking the left and right arrows on the keyboard.
            For each displayed image the scanner sound will start, as if it were taken on the spot.

            The title is the only element present besides the images, which is why it was included in the search bar. 
            Clicking on it makes it possible to search the images by name. Searching is the only moment when scanners 
            lose their anonymity, however, the name must be guessed.
